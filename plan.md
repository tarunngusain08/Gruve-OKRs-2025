# Yearly OKR Plan: Gruve-OKRs-2025

---

## Q1 (Jan–Mar): Foundation & Kickoff

### OS Fundamentals & Linux Kernel
- Study process management and memory management.
- Complete a simple Linux kernel module (`hello.c`).
- Use `top`, `htop`, and `strace` for process/memory analysis.

### Networking Fundamentals
- Learn OSI & TCP/IP models.
- Practice socket programming in Go/Python.

### Advanced Networking & Security
- Understand load balancing, proxies, and TLS basics.
- Study Kubernetes networking and basic security.

### AI Model Training
- Cover deep learning basics (PyTorch, TensorFlow).
- Try fine-tuning a small LLM.

---

## Q2 (Apr–Jun): Deepen & Apply

### OS Fundamentals & Linux Kernel
- Analyze process scheduling/memory usage with tools.
- Write more kernel modules.
- Explore file systems and storage.

### Networking Fundamentals
- Build server-client socket apps.
- Study IP addressing, subnetting, DNS, DHCP, routing.

### Advanced Networking & Cloud Networking
- Set up Nginx/HAProxy as reverse proxy with SSL.
- Learn cloud networking concepts (VPC, subnets, VPN).

### Security
- Implement basic Kubernetes security (PodSecurityPolicies, NetworkPolicies).

### AI Model Optimization
- Experiment with model quantization.
- Study model deployment strategies.

---

## Q3 (Jul–Sep): Advanced Concepts & Cloud

### OS & Containers
- Study kernel modules, system calls, container internals (cgroups, namespaces).

### Networking
- Explore advanced protocols (gRPC, connection pooling).
- Configure IPTables, eBPF, SELinux/AppArmor.

### Cloud Networking
- Practice with AWS/GCP networking, DNS/CDN (Route 53, Cloudflare).

### Security
- Implement mTLS, OAuth2, JWT for APIs.
- Explore IAM, RBAC, and advanced Kubernetes security.

### AI
- Optimize inference (TensorRT, ONNX, GPU).
- Deploy models using TF Serving or Triton.

---

## Q4 (Oct–Dec): Integration & Mastery

### OS & Networking
- Integrate knowledge: build a container, monitor with custom tools.
- Document learnings and create demos.

### Cloud & Security
- Secure a Kubernetes cluster end-to-end.
- Implement rate limiting, bot mitigation.

### AI
- Benchmark and optimize deployed models.
- Summarize and present your AI learnings.

---

## Ongoing (All Quarters)
- Document progress in `docs/progress.md`.
- Regularly review and update OKRs.
- Share learnings via blog posts or internal demos.

---

**Tip:** At the end of each quarter, update your progress and adjust the next quarter’s plan based on what you’ve learned or any blockers.
