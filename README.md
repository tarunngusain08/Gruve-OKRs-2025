## 1. OS Fundamentals & Linux Kernel

**Key Topics to Learn**
- Process Management (Scheduling, Threads, Fork, Exec, Signals).
- Memory Management (Paging, Segmentation, Virtual Memory, Swap).
- File Systems & Storage (EXT4, XFS, NFS, ZFS, Disk I/O).
- Kernel Modules & System Calls.
- Container Internals (cgroups, namespaces, seccomp).

**Hands-on Practice**
- Analyze process scheduling & memory usage using `top`, `htop`, `strace`.
- Write a simple Linux kernel module.

## 2. Networking Fundamentals

**Key Topics to Learn**
- OSI & TCP/IP Model (Layers, Protocols: HTTP, TCP, UDP, IP, ARP).
- IP Addressing & Subnetting (IPv4, IPv6, CIDR, NAT).
- DNS, DHCP, and Routing Basics.
- Sockets & Connection Handling in Golang/Python.

---

## 3. Advanced Networking & Cloud Networking

**Key Topics to Learn**
- Load Balancing, Proxies & Reverse Proxies (Nginx, HAProxy, Envoy).
- TLS, SSL, and mTLS (Certificate management).
- Firewall & Security (IPTables, eBPF, SELinux, AppArmor).
- Cloud Networking (AWS/GCP Networking, VPC, Subnets, VPN, SDN).
- DNS & CDN (Fastly, Cloudflare, AWS Route 53).

**Hands-on Practice**
- Set up Nginx or HAProxy as a reverse proxy with SSL termination.
- Configure IPTables rules and analyze network security.

## 4. Advanced Networking & Security

**Deepen Networking Knowledge**
- Study Envoy, Istio, Cilium to improve service mesh and networking in Kubernetes.
- Learn gRPC load balancing, connection pooling, and network optimizations.

**Enhance Security Skills**
- Implement mTLS, OAuth2, JWT-based authentication for APIs.
- Explore Cloud IAM, RBAC, and Network Policies in GCP/Oracle Cloud.
- Learn Web Security (OWASP Top 10, API security, rate limiting, bot mitigation like DataDome).

**Hands-on Practice**
- Secure a Kubernetes cluster using PodSecurityPolicies, NetworkPolicies, and Secrets Management.

## 5. AI Model Training & Optimization

**Understand AI Model Training**
- Study deep learning fundamentals (PyTorch, TensorFlow).
- Learn how to fine-tune LLMs (RAG-based AI agents, Transformer models).

**Optimize AI Inference**
- Improve model quantization, TensorRT, ONNX, and GPU optimizations.
- Study model deployment strategies (TF Serving, Triton Inference Server).
